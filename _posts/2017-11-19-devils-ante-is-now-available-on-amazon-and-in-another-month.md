  Devil’s Ante is now available on Amazon and in another month or so, it’ll also
  be available in audiobook format in wide publication. I’ll admit, I was a bit
  nervous going in to audiobooks but so far it’s been an interesting and
  enlightening experience. I’ve also met (at least in the web sense) some really
  interesting and talented people. Which makes me think I may try some other
  audio projects not related to books in the future.
